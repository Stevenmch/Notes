# Sending data C# and Python
These are my notes where I try to explain the connection between Python and C# (the code can be found in the respective folders). This connection between programming languages is really useful for me since now I can connect Python (my backend) with Unity (my frontend). Soon I will upload specifically how to connect Python and Unity where I will also try to explain the procedure with my notes and not just upload the code.
