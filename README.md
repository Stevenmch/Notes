# Sending data C# and Python
These are my notes where I try to explain the connection between Python and C# (the code can be found in the respective folders). This connection between programming languages is really useful for me because I can connect Python (my backend) with Unity (my frontend). Soon I will upload how to connect Python and Unity specifically. I will also try to explain the procedure with my notes.

### Resources
I used these books to understand the concepts of Server-Client UDP Protocol. However, **in these books do not explain how to connect Python with C#** but if you understand the concept you can do it.
